An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

# Example 1:
```
Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
```

# Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
```

# Example 3:
```
Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
```

# Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isUgly(int n) {
        
        // Base case
        if(n < 1)
            return false;
        
        // Mod by 2, 3, 5
        int arr[3] = {2, 3, 5};
        for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            while(n % arr[i] == 0)
                n /= arr[i];
        return n == 1;
    }
};
```
