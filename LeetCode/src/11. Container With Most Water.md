You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

# Example 1:
```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

# Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        
        int water = 0;
        int h = 0;
        int left = 0, right = height.size() - 1;
        while(left < right)
        {
            // Get min height and get current max water
            h = min(height[left], height[right]);
            water = max(water, (right - left) * h);
            
            // Modify two pointers until find more higher height
            while(left < right && height[left] <= h)
                left++;
            while(left < right && height[right] <= h)
                right--;
        }
        return water;
    }
};
```
