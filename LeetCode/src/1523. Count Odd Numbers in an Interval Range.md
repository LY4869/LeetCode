Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

# Example 1:
```
Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
```

# Example 2:
```
Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
```

# Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
    /**
     * the count of odd numbers between 1 and low - 1 is low / 2
     * the count of odd numbers between 1 and high is (high + 1 ) / 2
     * 
     * low = 3, high = 7
     * [[1, 2], 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
     * formula: ((high + 1) / 2) - (low / 2) **/
public:
    int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        return ((high + 1) / 2) - (low / 2);
    }
};
