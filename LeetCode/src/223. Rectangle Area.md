Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.
The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its top-right corner (ax2, ay2).
The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its top-right corner (bx2, by2).

# Example 1:
```
Rectangle Area
Input: ax1 = -3, ay1 = 0, ax2 = 3, ay2 = 4, bx1 = 0, by1 = -1, bx2 = 9, by2 = 2
Output: 45
```

# Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int computeArea(int ax1, int ay1, int ax2, int ay2, int bx1, int by1, int bx2, int by2) {
        
        // Calculate each rect
        int a1 = (ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1);
        int a2 = (bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1);
        
        // Return sum of two rect if is not overlap
        if(ax1 >= bx2 || ax2 <= bx1 || ay2 <= by1 || ay1 >= by2)
            return a1 + a2;
        
        // Calculate overlap area
        int overlap = (min(ax2, bx2) - max(ax1, bx1)) * (min(ay2, by2) - max(ay1, by1));
        
        // Remove overlap area
        return a1 + a2 - overlap;
    }
};
```
