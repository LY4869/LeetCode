Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words.
The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

# Example 1:
```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```


# Example 2:
```
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

# Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        
        // Reverse string 
        reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
        
        int i = 0, j = 0, size = s.size();
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        while(i < size)
        {
            // Find the first char
            while(i < size && s[i] == ' ')
                i++;
            
            left = j;
            // Left shift the char
            while(i < size && s[i] != ' ')
            {
                s[j++] = s[i++];
                right = j;
            }

            // Reverse the specific range of string
            reverse(s.begin() + left, s.begin() + right);
            
            // Add space to the end of the string
            s[j++] = ' ';
        }
        s.resize(right);
        return s;
    }
};
