Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
 
# Example 1:
```
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

# Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        
        // Each row, col, block has their own set
        vector<unordered_set<int>> row(9), col(9), block(9);
        for(int i = 0; i < 9; i++)
        {
            for(int j = 0; j < 9; j++)
            {
                // Skip if is not a number
                if(board[i][j] == '.')
                    continue;
                
                // Check each set whether has duplicate number
                int num = board[i][j] - '0';
                if(!col[i].insert(num).second ||
                   !row[j].insert(num).second ||
                   !block[(i / 3) * 3 + j / 3].insert(num).second)
                    return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
