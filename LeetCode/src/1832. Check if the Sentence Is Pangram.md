A pangram is a sentence where every letter of the English alphabet appears at least once.
Given a string sentence containing only lowercase English letters, return true if sentence is a pangram, or false otherwise.

# Example 1:
```
Input: sentence = "thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog"
Output: true
Explanation: sentence contains at least one of every letter of the English alphabet.
```

# Example 2:
```
Input: sentence = "leetcode"
Output: false
```

# Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkIfPangram(string sentence) {
        
        /** Method 1
         * Every alpha at least need to appear one time
         * Iterate sentence first, if found alpha mark to true
         * Iterate again, return false if element is false
        **/
        /** Method 2
         * bit mask
         * Left shift if find alpha
         * Check result whether is ((1 << 26) - 1)
        **/
        int seen = 0;
        for(auto& c : sentence)
        {
            // 1 11 111 ... 111...1
            seen = seen | (1 << (c - 'a'));
            
            // Check if len is 26
            if(seen == ((1 << 26) - 1))
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
