We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.

# Example 1:
```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

# Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

# Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        
        int left = 1, right = n;
        while(left <= right)
        {
            int mid = left + ((right - left) >> 1);
            if(guess(mid) == -1)
                right = mid - 1;
            else if (guess(mid) == 1)
                left = mid + 1;
            else
                return mid;
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```
